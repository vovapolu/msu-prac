In this task, it is required to implement several classes for preprocessing categorical features in order to
improve the quality of the linear model. Next, you need to use the newly implemented classes for preprocessing
and answer the questions in the attached notebook.

Running tests:
```bash
python run.py onehot
python run.py weights
python run.py counters
python run.py foldcounters
```
