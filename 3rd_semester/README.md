### Practicum
- Creating a dictionary by frequency for some text ([frequency_dictionary](.//projects/frequency_dictionary));
- Encoding converter from UTF16 to UTF8 ([converter_of_character_encodings](.//projects/converter_of_character_encodings));
- Model of Shell Interpreter ([shell](.//projects/shell)).

### Homework assignment
- Shell Sort ([ht_1_1.c](./hw_09_08/ht_1_1.c));
- The longest string ([ht_2.c](./hw_09_15/ht_2.c));
- Prime numbers and Fibonacci numbers ([hw_09_22.c](./hw_09_22/hw_09_22.c));
- String handling ([hw_09_29_lines.c](./hw_09_29/hw_09_29_lines.c));
- Binary search tree and operations with it ([hw_09_29_bin_tree.c](./hw_09_29/hw_09_29_bin_tree.c));
- Stack (fixed size) and deque (dynamic) with operations ([hw_09_29_stack_deque.c](./hw_09_29/hw_09_29_stack_deque.c));
- The program reads the code of the C program and prints in alphabetical order all groups of variable names in which the first `n` characters match, but the subsequent ones differ in some way ([hw_09_29_find_names.c](./hw_09_29/hw_09_29_find_names.c));
- Cross-reference table ([hw_09_29_cross_references.c](./hw_09_29/hw_09_29_cross_references.c));
- Implementing an analog of the `fgets()` function ([hw_10_27_fgets.c](./hw_10_27/hw_10_27_fgets.c));
- Sorting a binary file with integers ([hw_10_27_sort_bin_file.c](./hw_10_27/hw_10_27_sort_bin_file.c));
- Implementation of programs that simulate SHELL commands ([hw_11_10](./hw_11_10));
- The implementation of the command SHELL; the calculation of the received signal SIGTRAP ([hw_11_17](./hw_11_17)).
