<b>[v1_1](./v1_1.cpp):</b><br>

Describe an abstract class `IntSeq` that contains some sequence of integers and describes a pure virtual function and a constructor:

```cpp
virtual int Distance() const;   // to calculate some distance
IntSeq(int *pSeq, int n);       // pSeq – address of the beginning of the sequence, n – its length
```

The constructor must store a copy of the specified sequence in dynamic memory. Automatic memory cleaning should be provided, when the object ceases to exist. <br><br>

The `OrderedSeq` class should be inherited from `IntSeq`, and should store a strictly ascending sequence of integers (the base class is used to store this sequence, the `OrderedSeq` class should not have its own data fields). If an unordered sequence is set an exception of `BadSeq` type should be thrown (the class can be kept empty). Define the `Distance()` function as the maximum modulus of the difference between adjacent elements of the sequence. <br><br>

The class should have an addition operation, which builds a new sequence from two ordered sequences by concatenation (it joins the second sequence to the first one). If the constructed sequence is not ordered, then an exception of the `BadConcat` class should be thrown, whose object must contain left and right borders of both sequences that could not be concatenated. <br><br>

The result is the following `main()` function:

```cpp
int main() {
    try {
        int a[] = {1, 2, 3};
        int b[] = {7, 9, 10, 13};
        int c[] = {5, 6};
        OrderedSeq sa(a, 3), sb(b, 4), sc(c, 2); 
        cout << (sa + sb).Distance() << ", " << (sc + sb).Distance() << ", " << (sa + sc + sb).Distance() << endl; 
        cout << (sb + sc) .Distance() << endl; 
    }
    catch (const BadConcat& bad) {
        cout << "Bad concatenation " << bad.GetLeft1() << ", " << bad.GetRight1() << " + " << bad.GetLeft2() << ", " << bad.GetRight2() << endl; 
    }
    catch (BadSeq) { 
        cout << "Bad sequence\n"; 
    }       
    return 0; 
}
```
It should compile without errors and warnings, work and issue:
```cpp
4, 3, 3
Bad concatenation 7, 13 + 5, 6
```
All fields must be in the private part of the base class, and only member functions can be public and protected. The use of the friend directive is prohibited. <br>
Constructors are used to initialize objects. No methods should change the internal fields of objects, only functions that return field values but do not change anything are allowed. All occupied memory must be freed.

<br> <b> [v1_2](./v1_2.cpp): </b><br>

Describe the `Cls` class (and, if necessary, other classes) so that the evaluation of an expression of the form `x = c[N]` (where `c` is an object of the class `Cls`, `x` is an int variable, `N` is an expression that is reduced to int) enters the value `N + 1` in the variable `x`, and the evaluation of an expression of the form `c[N] >>= x` enters the value `N * 2` in the variable `x`. <br><br>

<b>Example:</b>

```cpp
int main() {
    Cls c;
    int x, N = 5;
    x = c[N];
    cout << x << "\n"; // print 6
    c[N] >>= x;
    cout << x << '\n'; // print 10
    return 0;
}
```

<br> <b> [v2_1](./v2_1.cpp): </b><br>

Describe an abstract class `IntPair`, that represents a pair of numbers of type int and describes a pure virtual function and a constructor:

```cpp
virtual  int  Measure() const;  // to calculate some measure
IntPair(int x, int y);
```

The `IntRectangle` class should be inherited from `IntPair`, and should define the concept of a rectangle with integer sides stored in the base class (the first number is length, the second is width), the `IntRectangle` class should not have its own data fields. If a rectangle constructs with negative sides, an exception of `BadRectangle` type should be thrown (the class can be left empty). Define the `Measure()` function as the area of the rectangle. <br><br>

The class should have an addition operation that "glues" two rectangles: if they have the same width, then glue them together along the length, otherwise, if the same length – then along the width. For example, adding rectangles 5x4 and 7x4 will give a rectangle 12x4, 5x4 + 5x2 will give a rectangle 5x6, 5x3 + 5x3 will give 10x3. If the rectangles do not have two suitable sides (for example, 5x3 and 3x5 or 5x3 and 6x4), then an exception of the `BadAdd` class should be thrown, the object of which must contain the sides of both rectangles that could not be folded. <br><br>

The result is the following main() function:

```cpp
int main() { 
    try {
        IntRectangle a(5, 4), b(7, 4), c(2, 1), d(2, 3);
        IntRectangle p, q;
        p = a + b;
        q = c + d;
        cout << (p+q).Measure() << endl;
        cout << (p+d).Measure() << endl; 
    }
    catch (const BadAdd &bad) {
        cout << "Bad add: (" << bad.GetX1() << " x " << bad.GetY1() << ") + (" << bad.GetX2() << " x " << bad.GetY2() << ")\n";  
    }
    catch (BadRectangle b) { 
        cout << "Bad rectangle\n"; 
    }       
    return 0; 
}
```
It should compile without errors and warnings, work and issue:
```cpp
56
Bad add: (12 x 4) + (2 x 3)
```
All fields must be in the private part of the base class, and only member functions can be public and protected. The use of the friend directive is prohibited.

<br> <b> [v2_2](./v2_2.cpp): </b><br>

Describe the `Assign` class (and, if necessary, other classes) so that the evaluation of an expression of the form `a[x](y)` (where `a` is an object of the `Assign` class, `x` is an int variable, and y is an expression that is a cast to int) enters the value y in the variable x, while the assigned value is stored in the object a and can be obtained by the `Get()` method. <br><br>

<b>Example:</b>

```cpp
int main() {
    Assign a;
    int x = -1, y = 5;
    a[x](y);
    cout << a.Get() << endl; // print 5
    cout << x << endl;       // print 5
    return 0;
}
```
